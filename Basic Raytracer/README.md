# Homework IV: Ray Tracing Engine
# CS 440 Computer Graphics, Fall 2020
***

# Purpose

This homework sets the foundation of an extendable ray tracing engine using principles of Object Oriented design. It implements some of the ray tracing topics we have covered, namely:

- tracing a ray through a scene
- sampling a scene
- perspective and parallel projection
- ray-primitive intersections

# Background

For this homework, you must know

- how to read and write object oriented code in C++
- how to compile a c++ project spanning multiple files in multiple directories
- vector arithmetic

# The Problem Set

The problems are defined in `hw4.tex` which is to be compiled using a LaTeX compiler.

## Time Requirement.

Previous teams (of 2) that worked on this homework reported the following number of hours for their attempt.
- (min, max) : (0, 100)
- (mean, median, stdev) : (57.5, 56.67, 39.62)

# Grading

Grading will be as per the criteria specified in the accompanying review file, _hw4-review.xlsx_.

# Submission

There are 3 parts to the submission.

## 4.1 Problem Set

Submit _all_ code files in the `raytracer` folder and its relevant subfolders. `World.cpp` should include an implementation of `World::build` corresponding to your desired scene. Compiling and running `raytracer.cpp` in the `raytracer` folder should generate the corresponding image as `scene.ppm`. You may include other `World::build` implementations in the `build` folder. 

Any files in your GitHub repository with these names at the time of the deadline will be considered as your submission. Your submissions will be peer reviewed so please do not include identifying information. Your code will be run by a peer on their machine _as is_ so make sure not to include non-portable files.

_Deadline_: 2359h on Friday, 27 November

## 4.2 Feedback Form

You will provide feedback on your teammates and on the assignment. The related form will be available on LMS with further instructions.

_Deadline_: 2359h on Monday, 30 November

## 4.3 Peer Review

You will review and grade 2 submissions which will be shared with you. The related instructions will be available on LMS with further instructions.

_Deadline_: 2359h on Monday, 30 November

# Tips

- Do not include identifying information in your submission.
- There is no late submission. Submit whatever you have by the deadline.
- Failure to turn in any of the above submissions will result in a withholding of marks for the homework.
- viel Spa√ü!

# Discussion

There is a lot to handle and there are bound to be confusions and queries. Please utilize the following avenues.

- discuss with your teammate,
- the discussion forum on LMS,
- discuss with your peers,
- talk to course staff.
